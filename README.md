# BuildPower Briefing Document

## It's Time To Build.

The Build Power Initiative is a diverse coalition of grass roots, civic, non-profit, corporate, and government organizations with the mission of restoring hope to communities that have been historically disenfranchised, marginalized, and/or displaced with practical and innovative, democratic, open source, and cooperative solution frameworks to counter destabilization, inequality, and injustice. 

## Our Vision.
Our vision is a hundreds of volunteers creating a wholistic open source community development framework utilized by thousands of communities working together to serve their own needs, build their local economies, house their citizens, produce their energy, grow their  food and communicate with each other to share best practices and solve problems together.

## Our Inspiration
We are inspired by by a wide range of concepts, initiatives and organizations such as Linux, Intentional Communities, Growing Power, Community Land Trusts, Open Source Ecology, Cohousing, Mondragon, New Communities Inc, Permaculture, Wikipedia, Occupy, and a few more.  From our ongoing analysis, each of these have within it a small piece of the big solution that we must develop as a species in other to remain viable on this planet.  While other organizations point to the developing world as the place they feel needs the most help our operational project foci will be on both inner city ghettos and the almost solid block of poverty that is the United States South.

## Who are we?
We are you.  You are we.  We represent cooperatives, civic and corporate entities, non profits, grass roots organizations, and the faith community working together to build a better, more just system by empowering those with the least to create stability in environments long plagued by instability.  We are those who believe that armed with the proper tools, all communities can thrive and create prosperity.
